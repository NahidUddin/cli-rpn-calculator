# cli-rpn-calculator
This is a basic command line tool that implements  (currently) four basic operators. Order of operations is not yet implemented, so at this point at most  only 3 tokens can be entered and only in order  (ie, two numbers separated by an operand).  From the command prompt, simply enter "run" in the root directory of the project. Requires Java 8 to run.
